\chapter*{Abstract}
\paragraph*{}
In the current academic and research scene, the topics of embedded systems and robotics are of high interest and need, though learners often find that they lack the needed fundamentals in electronics to conduct their projects and research. This project proposes a visual education solution for fundamental electronics and electric circuit simulation, by harvesting the concepts and technologies of gamification, game design, and puzzle design.

\paragraph*{}
Recent literature, projects, and gamification attempts are reviewed, and it is found that gamification of education yields many positive results due to (a) increased engagement, and (b) learners’ eagerness to collect achievements (trophies), along with several other factors. The game production industry is home to countless professional talents in engineering, art, design, and management; our project, a 2D puzzle video game, is an attempt at combining said talent with the thoroughness of academic curriculums, to bring together an entertaining, yet fruitful educational experience.
